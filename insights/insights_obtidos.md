### üìà Observed Trends

* We saw consistent growth from May through August, with sales peaking in August 2024 at R$42,542.00.
* Following this peak, there was a significant drop in September (R$28,142.00).
* October showed a partial recovery, bringing in R$29,695.00 in revenue.

### üí° Key Takeaways

* August might represent a strategic period for us (e.g., back-to-school campaigns, winter season in Brazil, etc.).
* The decline after the August peak could suggest a lack of ongoing campaigns or unfavorable seasonality.
* Despite November typically being associated with Black Friday, its weak performance might indicate a missed opportunity or the absence of specific, compelling promotions during that time.
